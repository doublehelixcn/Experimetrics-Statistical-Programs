# Experimetrics-Statistical-Programs

In this project, we will use R and Python to replicate the main examples in *Peter G. Moffatt*'s book **Experimetrics**.

Why do we work on this? In Moffatt's book, most of the programs are implemented with Stata. Stata works well for a lot of economists. But as a commericial software, some people may not use Stata for some reason: high price, small user base outside of social scientisits etc.

Hence we think some open source softwares such as R or Python could be good candidates. For us, it is both a practice and service for the excellent book **Experimetrics**.
